####Network Topology Simulator
A Python-based tool for simulating and visualizing network topologies, with the ability to simulate traffic flow between nodes.

#####Overview
The Network Topology Simulator allows users to:

#####Create custom network topologies by adding nodes and edges.
Visualize the topology as a graph.
Simulate traffic flow between nodes and highlight the path taken.
This project is ideal for students, researchers, and network engineers looking to study or demonstrate the behavior of network structures.

#####Features
Customizable Topology: Add nodes and edges with optional weights (e.g., bandwidth or latency).
Visualization: Automatically generates and displays a graph of the network.
Traffic Simulation: Simulate and visualize the shortest path between two nodes based on edge weights.
